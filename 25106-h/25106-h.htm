    <h2>
      "THE GALLANT, GOOD RIOU"
    </h2>
    <p>
      This is a true story of one of Nelson's captains, he of whom Nelson wrote
      as "the gallant and good Riou"&mdash;high meed of praise gloriously won at
      Copenhagen&mdash;but Riou, eleven years before that day, performed a deed,
      now almost forgotten, which, for unselfish heroism, ranks among the
      brightest in our brilliant naval annals, and in the sea story of Australia
      in particular.
    </p>
    <p>
      In September, 1789, the <i>Guardian</i>, a forty-gun ship, under the
      command of Riou, then a lieutenant, left England for the one-year-old
      penal settlement in New South Wales. The little colony was in sore need of
      food&mdash;almost starving, in fact&mdash;and Riou's orders were to make
      all haste to his destination, calling at the Cape on the way to embark
      live stock and other supplies. All the ship's guns had been removed to
      make room for the stores, which included a "plant cabin"&mdash;a temporary
      compartment built on deck for the purpose of conveying to Sydney, in pots
      of earth, trees and plants selected by Sir Joseph Banks as likely to be
      useful to the young colony&mdash;making her deck "a complete garden," says
      a newspaper of the time. Friends of the officers stationed in New South
      Wales sent on board the Guardian great quantities of private goods, and
      these were stored in the gun-room, which it was thought would be a safer
      place than the hold, but, as the event proved, it was the most insecure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ship arrived at the Cape of Good Hope in November, and there filled
      her decks with cattle and provisions, then sailed again, her cargo being
      equal in value to about Â£70,000. On December 23rd&mdash;twelve days after
      leaving the Cape&mdash;what is described as "an island of ice" was seen.
      Riou gave orders to stand towards it in order to renew, by collecting
      lumps of ice, the supply of water, the stock of fresh water having run
      very low in consequence of the quantity consumed by the cattle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Public Advertiser of April 30, 1790, describes what now happened. As
      the ship approached the island, the boats were hoisted out and manned, and
      several lumps collected. During this time the ship lay to, and on the ice
      being brought on board she attempted to stand away. Very little
      apprehension was at this time entertained of her safety, although the
      enormous bulk of the island occasioned an unfavourable current, and in
      some measure gave a partial direction to the wind. On a sudden, the base
      of the island, which projected under water considerably beyond the limits
      of the visible parts, struck the bow of the ship; she instantly swung
      round, and her head cleared, but her stern, coming on the shoal, struck
      repeatedly, and the sea being very heavy, her rudder broke away, and all
      her works abaft were shivered. The ship in this situation became, in a
      degree, embayed under the terrific bulk of ice, for its height was twice
      that of the mainmast of a ship of the line, and the prominent head of the
      berg was every moment expected to break away and overwhelm the ship. At
      length, after every practicable exertion, she was got off the shoal, and
      the ice floated past her. It was soon perceived that the <i>Guardian</i>
      had six feet of water in her hold, and it was increasing very fast The
      hands were set to the pumps, others to find out the leaks, and they
      occasionally relieved each other. Thus they continued labouring
      unceasingly on the 24th, although on the 23rd not one of them had had the
      least rest The ship was at one period so much relieved that she had only
      two feet of water in the hold; but at this time, when their distress wore
      the best aspect, the water "increased in a moment to ten feet." Then the
      ship was discovered to be strained in all her works, and the sea running
      high, every endeavour to check the progress of a particular leak proved
      ineffectual. To lighten the ship, the cows, horses, sheep, and all the
      other live stock for the colony were, with their fodder, committed to the
      deep to perish.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Williams, boatswain of the <i>Guardian</i>, wrote to his parents in
      London, and told them about the disaster, and although we have no doubt he
      was handier with the marline-spike than with his pen, some of his badly
      spelled letter reads well:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "This axident happened on the 23rd of December, and on the 25th the boats
      left us with moast of the officers and a great part of the seamen. The
      master-gunner, purser, one master's mate, one midshipman, and a parson,
      with nine seamen, was got into the longboat and cleared the ship. The
      doctor and four or five men got into a cutter and was upset close to the
      ship, and all of them was drowned. As for the rest of the boats, I believe
      they must be lost and all in them perished, for wee was about six hundred
      leagues from any land. There was about fifty-six men missing; a number
      drowned jumping into the boats; the sea ran so high that the boats could
      scarce live. The commander had a strong resulution, for he said he would
      sooner go down in the ship than he wold quid her. All the officers left in
      the ship was the commander, the carpenter, one midshipman, and myself.
      After the boats left us we had two chances&mdash;either to jump or sink.
      We cold just get into the sailroom and got up a new forecourse and stuck
      it full of oakum and rags, and put itt under the ship's bottom; this is
      called fothering the ship. We found some benefit by itt for pumping and
      bailing we gained on hur; that gave us a little hope of saving our lives.
      We was in this terable situation for nine weeks before we got to the Cape
      of Good Hope. Sometimes our upper-deck scuppers was under water outside,
      and the ship leying like a log on the water, and the sea breaking over her
      as if she was a rock. Sixteen foot of water was the common run for the
      nine weeks in the hold. I am not certain what we are to doo with the ship
      as yet. We have got moast of our cargo out; it is all dammaged but the
      beef and pork, which is in good order. I have lost a great dele of my
      cloaths, and I am thinking of drawing of about six pound, wich I think I
      can make shift with. If this axident had not hapned I shold not have had
      aney call for aney. As for my stores, there is a great part of them thrown
      overboard; likewise all the officers stores in the ship is gone the same
      way, for evry thing that came to hand was thrown ovarboard to lighten the
      ship. I think that we must wait till ordars comes from England to know
      what we are to do with the ship."
    </p>
    <p>
      The chronicles of the time also relate how at daylight on Christmas
      morning, when the water was reported as being up to the orlop deck and
      gaining two feet an hour, many of the people desponded and gave themselves
      up for lost. A part of those who had any strength left, seeing that their
      utmost efforts to save the ship were likely to be in vain, applied to the
      officers for the boats, which were promised to be in readiness for them,
      and the boatswain was directly ordered to put the masts, sails, and
      compasses in each. The cooper was also set to work to fill a few
      quarter-casks of water out of some of the butts on deck, and provisions
      and other necessaries were got up from the hold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many hours previous to this, Lieutenant Riou had privately declared to his
      officers that he saw the final loss of the ship was inevitable, and he
      could not help regretting the loss of so many brave fellows. "As for me,"
      said he, "I have determined to remain in the ship, and shall endeavour to
      make my presence useful as long as there is any occasion for it." He was
      entreated, and even supplicated, to give up this fatal resolution, and try
      for safety in the boats. It was even hinted to him how highly criminal it
      was to persevere in such a determination; but he was not to be moved by
      any entreaties. He was, notwithstanding, as active in providing for the
      safety of the boats as if he intended to take the opportunity of securing
      his own escape. He was throughout as calm and collected as in the happier
      moments of his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      At seven o'clock the <i>Guardian</i> had settled considerably abaft, and
      the water was coming in at the rudder-case in great quantities. At
      half-past seven the water in the hold obliged the people below to come
      upon deck; the ship appeared to be in a sinking state, and settling bodily
      down; it was, therefore, almost immediately agreed to have recourse to the
      boats. While engaged in consultation on this melancholy business, Riou
      wrote a letter to the Admiralty, which he delivered to Mr. Clements, the
      master. It was as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "H.M.S. Guardian, Dec. 25, 1789.

     "If any part of the officers or crew of the <i>Guardian</i>
     should ever survive to get home, I have only to say their
     conduct, after the fatal stroke against an island of ice,
     was admirable and wonderful in everything that relates to
     their duty, considered either as private men, or in His
     Majesty's service. As there seems to be no possibility of my
     remaining many hours in this world, I beg leave to recommend
     to the considÃ©ration of the Admiralty a sister, who, if my
     conduct or service should be found deserving any memory,
     their favour might be shown to, together with a widowed
     mother.

     "I am, &amp;c,

     "Phil. Stephens, Esq."

     "E. RIOU.
</pre>
    <p>
      With the utmost difficulty the boats were launched. After they were got
      afloat and had cleared the ship, with the exception of the launch they
      were never afterwards heard of; the launch with nine survivors was picked
      up by a passing vessel ten days after she left the wreck, her people
      reduced to the last extremity for want of food and water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the survivors was the parson mentioned by the boatswain. This was
      the Rev. Mr. Crowther, who was on his way as a missionary to the penal
      settlement. The Rev. John Newton, of Olney (poet Cowper's Newton), had got
      Crowther the appointment, at "eight shillings per diem, of assistant
      chaplain of the settlement," and Newton, writing to the Rev. R. Johnson,
      chaplain of Sydney, tells how he heard of the loss of the Guardian, "and
      the very next morning Mr. Crowther knocked at my door himself." Then Mr.
      Newton writes a letter which shows that Mr. Crowther had had enough of the
      sea. "It is not a service for mere flesh and blood to undertake. A man
      without that apostolic spirit and peculiar call which the Lord alone can
      give would hardly be able to maintain his ground. Mr. Crowther, though a
      sincere, humble, good man, seems not to have had those qualifications, and
      therefore he has been partly intimidated by what he met with abroad, and
      partly influenced by nearer personal considerations at home, to stay with
      us and sleep in a whole skin." But after his experience it was not to be
      wondered at that he preferred to stay at home and sleep in a whole skin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Riou, in spite of a ship without a rudder, and with the water in
      her up to the orlop deck, succeeded, as the boatswain's letter shows,
      after a voyage of nine weeks, in bringing his command to the Cape. A
      letter from Capetown, written on March 1, 1790, tells us she arrived there
      "eight days ago in a situation not to be credited without ocular proofs.
      She had, I think, nine feet of water in her when she anchored. The lower
      gun-deck served as a second bottom; it was stowed with a very great weight
      equally fore and aft. To this, and to the uncommon strength of it, Captain
      Riou ascribes his safety. Seeing an English ship with a signal of
      distress, four of us went on board, scarcely hoping but with busy fancy
      still pointing her out to be the <i>Guardian</i>, and, to our
      inexpressible joy, we found it was her. We stood in silent admiration of
      her heroic commander (whose supposed fate had drawn tears from us before),
      shining through the rags of the meanest sailor. The fortitude of this man
      is a glorious example for British officers to emulate. Since that time we
      have gone on board again to see him. He is affable in his manners, and of
      most commanding presence.... Perhaps we, under the influence of that
      attraction which great sufferings always produce, may, in the enthusiasm
      of our commendation, be too lavish in his praise; were it not for this
      fear I would at once pronounce him the most God-like mortal I ever viewed.
      They were two months from the time the accident happened until they
      reached this place. Every man shared alike in the labour; and not having
      at all attended to their persons during the whole of that dismal period
      they looked like men of another world&mdash;long beards, dirt, and rags
      covered them. Mr. Riou got one of his hands crushed and one of his legs
      hurt, but all are getting well. None of his people died during their
      fatigues. He says his principal attention was to keep up their spirits and
      to watch over their health. He never allowed himself to hope until the day
      before he got in here, when he made the land. Destitute of that support,
      how superior must his fortitude be! He has this morning, for the first
      time, come on shore, having been employed getting stores, &amp;c., out to
      lighten the ship. He wavers what to do with her&mdash;whether to put
      Government to the expense of repairing her here (which would almost equal
      her first cost, perhaps exceed it) or burn her. Most likely the last will
      be resolved on."
    </p>
    <p>
      The ship was in such a state that she was condemned by the experts at the
      Cape, but Riou, bearing in mind the distressed state of the colony of New
      South Wales, did not rest until he had sent on in other vessels all the
      stores he could collect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither did he forget the behaviour of certain convicts. In a letter to
      the Admiralty he wrote: "Permit me, sir, to address you on a subject which
      I hope their Lordships will not consider to be unworthy their notice. It
      is to recommend as much as is in my power to their Lordships' favour and
      interest the case of the twenty convicts which my duty compelled me to
      send to Port Jackson. But the recollection of past sufferings reminds me
      of that time when I found it necessary to make use of every possible
      method to encourage the minds of the people under my command, and at such
      time, considering how great the difference might be between a free man
      struggling for life and him who perhaps might consider death as not much
      superior to a life of ignominy and disgrace I publicly declared that not
      one of them, so far as depended on myself, should ever be convicts. And I
      may with undeniable truth say that, had it not been for their assistance
      and support, the <i>Guardian</i> would never have arrived to where she is.
      Their conduct prior to the melancholy accident that happened on December
      23rd last was always such as may be commended, and from their first
      entrance into the ship at Spithead they ever assisted and did their duty
      in like manner as the crew. I have taken the liberty to recommend them to
      the notice of Governor Phillip; but I humbly hope, sir, their Lordships
      will consider the service done by these men as meriting their Lordships'
      favour and protection, and I make no doubt that should I have been so
      fortunate as to represent this in proper colours, that they will
      experience the benefit of their Lordships' interest."
    </p>
    <p>
      The prisoners were pardoned, and the Secretary of the Admiralty wrote to
      Riou&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have their Lordships' commands to acquaint you that their concern on
      the receipt of the melancholy contents of the first-mentioned letter could
      only be exceeded by the satisfaction they received from the account of
      your miraculous escape, which they attribute to your skilful and judicious
      exertions under the favour of Divine Providence.... Their Lordships have
      communicated to Mr. Secretary Grenville, for his Majesty's information,
      your recommendation of the surviving convicts whose conduct, as it has so
      deservedly met with your approbation, will, there is every reason to hope,
      entitle them to his Majesty's clemency."
    </p>
    <p>
      [This story of the gallant behaviour of these twenty prisoners does not
      stand alone in the convict annals of Australia. There were many other
      instances in which convicts behaved with the greatest heroism. Many of the
      earlier explorers, such as Sturt, received most valuable aid from
      prisoners who were members of their expeditions; and in the first days of
      the colony both Phillip and Hunter were quick to recognise and personally
      reward or recommend for pardon to the Home Government convicts who had
      distinguished themselves by acts of bravery.]
    </p>
    <p>
      When Riou returned to England he was promoted to post-captain's rank, and
      at Copenhagen, in 1801, he commanded the <i>Amazon</i>. Perhaps we may be
      forgiven for reprinting from Southey's "Nelson" an account of what he did
      there. "The signal" (that famous one which Nelson looked at with his blind
      eye), "the signal, however, saved Riou's little squadron, but did not save
      its heroic leader. The squadron, which was nearest the commander-in-chief,
      obeyed and hauled off. It had suffered severely in its most unequal
      contest. For a long time the <i>Amazon</i> had been firing enveloped in
      smoke, when Riou desired his men to stand fast, and let the smoke clear
      off, that they might see what they were about. A fatal order, for the
      Danes then got clear sight of her from the batteries, and pointed their
      guns with such tremendous effect that nothing but the signal for retreat
      saved this frigate from destruction. 'What will Nelson think of us!' was
      Riou's mournful exclamation when he unwillingly drew off. He had been
      wounded in the head by a splinter, and was sitting on a gun, encouraging
      his men, when, just as the <i>Amazon</i> showed her stern to the Trekroner
      Battery, his clerk was killed by his side, and another shot swept away
      several marines who were hauling in the main-brace. 'Come, then, my boys!'
      cried Riou, 'let us die all together!' The words had scarcely been uttered
      before a raking shot cut him in two. Except it had been Nelson himself,
      the British Navy could not have suffered a severer loss."

    <h2>
      JACK RENTON
    </h2>
    <p>
      Some yarns of an exceedingly tough and Munchausen-like character have been
      spun and printed by men of their adventures in Australian waters or the
      South Seas, but an examination of such stories by any one with personal
      knowledge of the Pacific and Australasia has soon, and very deservedly so,
      knocked the bottom out of a considerable number of them. Yet there are
      stories of South Sea adventure well authenticated, which I are not a whit
      less wonderful than the most marvellous falsehoods that any man has yet
      told, and the story of what befell John Renton is one of these. A file of
      the <i>Queenslander</i> (the leading Queensland weekly newspaper) for 1875
      will corroborate his story; for that paper gave the best account of his
      adventures in one of their November (1875) numbers, and the story was
      copied into nearly every paper in Australasia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like Harry Bluff, John Renton "when a boy left his friends and his home,
      o'er the wild ocean waves all his life for to roam." Renton's home was in
      Stromness, in the Orkneys, and he shipped on board a vessel bound to
      Sydney, in 1867, as an ordinary seaman, he then being a lad of eighteen.
      When in Sydney he got about among the boarding-houses, in sailor-town, and
      one morning woke up on the forecastle of the <i>Reynard</i> of Boston,
      bound on a cruise for guano among the South Pacific Islands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Renton had been crimped, and finding himself where he was, bothered no
      more about it, but went cheerfully to work, not altogether displeased at
      the prospect of new adventures, which would enable him to by and by go
      back to the old folks with plenty of dollars, and a stock of startling
      yarns to reel off. He was a steady, straightforward lad, though somewhat
      thoughtless at times, and resolved to be a steady, straightforward man.
      The vessel first called into the Sandwich Islands, and there shipped a
      gang of Hawaiian natives to help load the guano, then she sailed away to
      the southward for McKean's Island, one of the Phoenix Group, situated
      about lat. 3? 35' S. and long. 174? 20' W.
    </p>
    <p>
      On board the <i>Reynard</i> was an old salt known to all hands as "Boston
      Ned." He had been a whaler in his time, had deserted, and spent some years
      beachcombing among the islands of the South Seas, and very soon, through
      his specious tongue, he had all hands wishing themselves clear of the "old
      hooker" and enjoying life in the islands instead of cruising about, hazed
      here and there and everywhere by the mates of the <i>Reynard</i>, whose
      main purpose in life was to knock a man down in order to make him "sit
      up." Presently three or four of the hands became infatuated with the idea
      of settling on an island, and old Ned, nothing loth, undertook to take
      charge of the party if they would make an attempt to clear from the ship.
      The old man had taken a fancy to young Renton, and the youngster, when the
      idea was imparted to him, fell in with it enthusiastically; for he was
      exasperated with the treatment he had received on board the guanoman&mdash;the
      afterguard of an American guano ship are usually a rough lot The ship was
      lying on and off the land, there being no anchorage, and before the plan
      had been discussed more than a few hours, the men, five in all, determined
      to put it into execution.
    </p>
    <p>
      A small whaleboat was towing astern of the vessel in case the wind should
      fall light and the ship drift in too close to the shore. It was a fine
      night, with a light breeze, and there was, they thought, a good chance of
      getting to the southward, to one of the Samoan group, where they could
      settle, or by shipping on board a trading schooner they might later on
      strike some other island to their fancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      By stealth they managed to stow in the boat a couple of small breakers of
      water, holding together sixteen gallons, and the forecastle bread barge
      with biscuits enough for three meals a day per man for ten days. They
      managed also to steal four hams, and each man brought pipes, tobacco, and
      matches. A harpoon with some line, an old galley frying-pan, mast, sail
      and oars, and some blankets completed the equipment For they took no
      compass, though they made several attempts to get at one slung in the
      cabin, and tried at first to take one out of the poop binnacle; but the
      officer of the watch on deck was too wide awake for them to risk that, and
      the cabin compass was screwed to the roof close to the skipper's berth;
      and so the old man who was their leader, old sailor and whaler as he was,
      actually gave up the idea of taking a compass, and these people without
      more ado, one night slipped over the side into the whaleboat, cut the
      painter, and by daylight the boat was out of sight of land and of the
      ship. They were afloat upon the Pacific, running six or seven miles before
      a north-east breeze and expecting to sight land in less than a week, and
      were already anticipating the freedom and luxury of island life in store
      for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three days later it fell calm, and they had to take to the oars. The sun
      was intensely hot, the water a sheet of glass reflecting back upon them
      the ball of fire overhead. Now and again a cats-paw would ripple across
      the plain of water, but there were no clouds, there was no sight of land.
      They kept on pulling. For three, for four days&mdash;a week&mdash;for ten
      days&mdash;they tugged at the oars, except when a favouring breeze came.
      The water was reduced to a few pints, the food to a few days'
      half-rations. Their limbs were cramped so that they could not move from
      their places in the boat, their bodies were becoming covered with sores;
      and the wind had now died away entirely, the sea was without a ripple, and
      for ever shone above them the fierce, relentless sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gradually it had dawned upon them that they were lost&mdash;that perhaps
      they had run past Samoa. The first eagerness of their adventure gave place
      to despair, and by degrees their despair grew to madness of a more awful
      kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the fifteenth day there appeared to the south and east a low, dark-grey
      cloud. "Land at last!" was the unspoken thought in each man's heart as he
      looked at his comrade, but feared to voice his hope. And presently the
      cloud grew darker and more clearly defined, and one of the men&mdash;the
      next oldest to the author of all their miseries&mdash;fell upon his weak
      and trembling knees, and raised his hands in thankfulness and prayer to
      the Almighty. Alas! it was not land, but the ominous forerunner of the
      fierce and sweeping mid-equatorial gale which lay veiled behind. In less
      than half an hour it came upon and smote them with savage fury, and the
      little boat was running before a howling gale and a maddened, foam-whipped
      sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then it happened that, ill and suffering as he was from the agonies of
      hunger and thirst, the heroic nature of old "Boston Ned" came out, and his
      bold sailor's heart cheered and encouraged his wretched, despairing
      companions. All that night, and for the greater part of the following day,
      he stood in the stern-sheets, grasping the bending steer-oar as the boat
      swayed and surged along before the gale, and constantly watching lest she
      should broach to and smother in the roaring seas; the others lay in the
      bottom, feebly baling out the water, encouraged, urged, and driven to that
      exertion by the gallant old American seaman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards noon the wind moderated, in the afternoon it died away altogether,
      and again the boat lay rising and falling to the long Pacific swell, and
      "Boston Ned" flung his exhausted frame down in the stern-sheets and slept.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the blood-red sun leapt from a sea of glassy smoothness&mdash;for
      the swell had subsided during the night&mdash;and again the wretched men
      locked into each other's dreadful faces and mutely asked what was to be
      done. How should they head the boat? Without a compass they might as well
      steer one way as another, for none of them knew even approximately the
      course for the nearest land; search the cloudless vault of blue above, or
      scan the shimmering sea-rim till their aching eyes dropped from out their
      hollowing sockets, there was no clue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twenty days out the last particle of food and water had been consumed, and
      though the boat was now steering as near westward as old Ned could judge,
      before a gentle south-east trade, madness and despair were coming quickly
      upon them, and on the twenty-third day two of the five miserable creatures
      began to drink copiously of salt water&mdash;the drink of Death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Renton, though he had suffered to the bitter full from the agonies of body
      and mind endured by his shipmates, did not yield to this temptation; and
      by a merciful providence remained sane enough to turn his face away from
      the water. But as he lay crouched in a heap in the bottom of the boat,
      with a silent prayer in his heart to his Creator to quickly end his
      sufferings, he heard "Boston Ned" and the only remaining sane man except
      himself muttering hoarsely together and looking sometimes at him and
      sometimes at the two almost dying men who lay moaning beside him.
      Presently the man who was talking to Ned pulled out of his blanket&mdash;which
      lay in the stern-sheets&mdash;a razor, and turning his back to Renton
      began stropping it upon the sole of his boot, and even "Boston Ned"
      himself looked with awful eyes and blood-baked twitching lips upon the
      youngster.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lad saw what was coming, and as quickly as possible made his way
      forward and sat there, with his eyes fixed upon the two men aft, waiting
      for the struggle which he thought must soon begin. All that day and the
      night he sat and watched, determined to make a fight for the little life
      which remained in him, and Ned and the other man at times still muttered
      and eyed him wolfishly.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so, on and on, these seeming outcasts of God's mercy sailed before the
      warm breath of the south-east trade wind, above them the blazing tropic
      sun, around them the wide, sailless expanse of the blue Pacific unbroken
      in its dreadful loneliness except for a wandering grey-winged booby or
      flocks of whale-birds floating upon its gentle swell, and within their all
      but deadened hearts naught but grim despair and a dulled sense of coming
      dissolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he sat thus, supporting his swollen head upon his skeleton hands,
      Renton saw something astern, moving slowly after the boat&mdash;something
      that he knew was waiting and following for the awful deed to be done, so
      that <i>it</i> too might share in the dreadful feast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Raising his bony arm, he pointed towards the moving fin. To him a shark
      meant no added horror or danger to their position, but possibly
      deliverance. "Boston Ned" and the other man first looked at the coming
      shark, and then with sunken eyes again turned to Renton. Voices none of
      them had, and the lad's parched tongue could not articulate, but with
      signs and lip movements he tried to make the other two men understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      No shark hook had they; nor, if they had had one, had they anything with
      which to bait it. But Renton, crawling aft, picked up the harpoon, placed
      it in "Boston Ned's" hands, and motioned to him to stand by. Then with
      eager, trembling hands he stripped from his legs the shreds of trousers
      which remained on them, and, sitting upon the gunwale of the boat, hung
      one limb over and let it trail in the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three times the shark came up, and thrice Ned prepared to strike, but each
      time the grim ranger of the seas turned aside as it caught sight of the
      waiting figure with weapon poised above. But at last hunger prevailed,
      and, swimming slowly up till within a few yards of the boat, it made a
      sudden rush for the human bait, missed it, and the harpoon, deftly darted
      by the old ex-whaler, clove through its tough skin and buried itself deep
      into its body between the shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      It took the worn-out, exhausted men a long time to haul alongside and
      despatch the struggling monster, which, says Renton, was ten feet in
      length.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then followed shark's flesh and shark's blood, some of the former, after
      the first raw meal, being cooked on a fire made of the biscuit barge upon
      a wet blanket spread in the bottom of the boat. The hot weather, however,
      soon turned the remaining portion putrid, but two or three days later came
      God's blessed rain, and gave them hope and life again. They managed to
      save a considerable quantity of water, and, though the shark's flesh was
      in a horrible condition, they continued to feed upon it <i>until the
      thirty-fifth</i> day.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this day they saw land, high and well wooded; but now the trade-wind
      failed them, and for the following two days the unfortunate men contended
      with baffling light airs, calms, and strong currents. At last they got
      within a short distance of the shore, and sought for a landing-place
      through the surrounding surf.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly four or five canoes darted out from the shore. They were filled
      with armed savages, whose aspect and demeanour warned old Ned that he and
      his comrades were among cannibals. Sweeping alongside the boat, the
      savages seized the white men, who were all too feeble to resist, or even
      move, put them into their canoes, and conveyed them on shore, fed them,
      and treated them with much apparent kindness. Crowds of natives from that
      part of the island&mdash;which was Malayta, one of the Solomon Group&mdash;came
      to look at them, and one man, a chief, took a fancy to Renton, and claimed
      him as his own especial property.
    </p>
    <p>
      Renton never saw the rest of his companions again, for they were removed
      to the interior of the Island&mdash;probably sold to some of the bush
      tribes, the "man-a-bush," as the coastal natives called them. Their fate
      is not difficult to guess, for the people of Malayta were then, as they
      are now, cannibals.
    </p>
    <p>
      On August 7, 1875, the Queensland labour recruiting schooner <i>Bobtail
      Nag</i> was cruising off the island, trading for yams, and her captain
      heard from some natives who came alongside that there was a white man
      living ashore in a village about ten miles distant. The skipper of the <i>Bobtail
      Nag</i> at once offered to pay a handsome price if the man was brought on
      board, and at the cost of several dozen Birmingham steel axes and some
      tobacco poor Renton's release was effected. He told his rescuers that the
      people among whom he had lived had taken a great fancy to him, and had
      treated him with great kindness.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the reader will look at a chart of the South Pacific, he will see,
      among the Phoenix Group, the position of McKean's Island; two thousand
      miles distant, westward and southward, is the island of Malayta, upon
      which Renton and his companions in misery drifted.
